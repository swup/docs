# Getting Started

## What is swup?

Swup is a versatile and extensible **page transition library** for server-rendered websites.
It manages the complete page load lifecycle and smoothly animates between the current and next
page. In addition, it offers many other quality-of-life improvements like **caching**, **smart preloading**,
native **browser history** and enhanced **accessibility**.

Make your site feel like a snappy single-page app — without any of the complexity.

## Try it out

Explore our [interactive demos](/getting-started/demos/) to see swup in action.

## Plugins

Swup is small by design. Extended features can be added via [plugins](/plugins/):

- Display a [progress bar](/plugins/progress-plugin/) while loading
- Enable [smooth scrolling](/plugins/scroll-plugin/) between visits
- Update [meta tags and stylesheets](/plugins/head-plugin/) after page loads
- Add support for [preloading pages](/plugins/preload-plugin/) in the background
- Perform your [animations in JS](/plugins/js-plugin/) instead of CSS transitions
- Animate [form submissions](/plugins/forms-plugin/)
- Improve [accessibility](/plugins/a11y-plugin/) for screen readers
- Get help in [debug mode](/plugins/debug-plugin/)

Check out the list of [official plugins](/plugins/) and [third-party plugins](/third-party-plugins/).

## Themes

Get started quickly with one of three official themes: [fade](/themes/fade-theme/),
[slide](/themes/slide-theme/), and [overlay](/themes/overlay-theme/).
