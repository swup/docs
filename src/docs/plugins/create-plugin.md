# Create a Plugin

Anyone can create and publish swup plugins. To create a new plugin, install the [swup CLI](/cli/)
and let it create one from a template. Or head over directly to the
[plugin template repo](https://github.com/swup/plugin-template) and follow the instructions there.

## Tips

- Check out existing plugins before creating one. Maybe the desired functionality can be integrated into an existing plugin?
- If you think your new plugin should be an official swup plugin and live under the `@swup/*` npm namespace, get in touch at gmarcuk@gmail.com.

## Developing plugins

### Accessing swup

The swup instance is automatically assigned to the plugin instance and can be accessed as
`this.swup` in the `mount` and `unmount` methods.

### Cleaning up

Plugins need to clean up after themselves in the `umount` method: cancel any event listeners, undo
any DOM changes, etc.

### Logging

Use swup's `log` method to output any relevant information. By default this method doesn't do
anything. It will starting outputting information only if installed alongside the
[debug plugin](/plugins/debug-plugin/).

### Replacing swup hooks

You might want to react to certain lifecycle hooks by replacing swup's internal handler completely.
The default handler is passed to the callback as the third parameter, should you decide to let
swup handle this hook based on some condition.

```javascript
this.swup.hooks.replace('replaceContent', (context, args, originalHandler) => {
  if (context.someCondition) {
    // Handle content replacement myself
  } else {
    // Let swup handle content replacement
    return originalHandler(context, args);
  }
});
```

### Custom hooks

You might need to create and trigger your own new hooks to implement additional functionality.

Create a new hook in `mount`:

```javascript
this.swup.hooks.create('submitForm');
```

Trigger the hook whenever makes sense:

```javascript
this.swup.hooks.trigger('submitForm');
```

Pass in arguments to hand them along to any registered handlers.

```javascript
this.swup.hooks.trigger('submitForm', { formData: 123 });
```

### Making custom hooks replaceable

Passing in a default handler when triggering a hook will allow users of your plugin
to replace this default handler with a custom implementation. This is an advanced pattern to avoid
monkeypatching instance methods.

In the example below, the default form handler uses `fetch` to submit the form.

```javascript
const args = { action: url, data: new FormData() };
this.swup.hooks.trigger('submitForm', args, (context, { action, data }) => {
  return fetch(action, { body: data }).then(/* */);
});
```

Consumers can now replace the default handler with a custom handler. In this example, they are
using axios to submit the form instead.

```javascript
swup.hooks.replace('submitForm', (context, { action, data }) => {
  return axios.get(action, { params: data }).then(/* */);
});
```
