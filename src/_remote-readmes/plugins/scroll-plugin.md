# Swup Scroll plugin

Adds awesome "acceleration based" automatic scrolling into the process of page transitions. The scrolling behaviour is customizable using options (see below).

## Installation

Install the plugin from npm and import it into your bundle.

```bash
npm install @swup/scroll-plugin
```

```js
import SwupScrollPlugin from '@swup/scroll-plugin';
```

Or include the minified production file from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@swup/scroll-plugin@2"></script>
```

## Usage

To run this plugin, include an instance in the swup options.

```javascript
const swup = new Swup({
  plugins: [new SwupScrollPlugin()]
});
```

## Behavior

Scroll Plugin works out of the box for sites where the `window` is the main scroll container,
scrolling back up on page visits and restoring the previous position on browser history visits.

### Scroll containers

If your site has other scroll containers than the `window`, like overflowing divs, the plugin will
happily restore their scroll positions as long as you let it know about those containers. You can
either add the attribute `[data-swup-scroll-container]` to them or use the
[scrollContainers](#scrollcontainers) option to configure a custom selector.

### Reset vs. restore

On each page navigation, the plugin will **reset** the scroll position to the top just like the
browser would. On backword/forward history visits, it will **restore** the previous scroll position
that was saved right before leaving the page.

You can customize when to reset vs. restore while clicking a link using the
[shouldResetScrollPosition](#shouldresetscrollposition) option. A common use case would be a
custom back button: clicking it would normally reset the scoll position to the top while users would expect it
to restore the previous scroll position on the page the link points towards.

## Options

### doScrollingRightAway

`doScrollingRightAway` defines if swup is supposed to wait for the replace of the page to scroll to the top.

### animateScroll

`animateScroll` defines whether the scroll animation is enabled or swup simply sets the scroll
without animation instead. Passing `true` or `false` will enable or disable all scroll animations.
For finer control, you can pass an object:

```javascript
{
  animateScroll: {
    betweenPages: true,
    samePageWithHash: true,
    samePage: true
  }
}
```

💡 We encourage you to respect user preferences when setting the `animateScroll` option:

```javascript
// Using a simple boolean...
{
  animateScroll: !window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches
}
// ...or this little monster, with full control over everything:
{
  animateScroll: window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches ? false : {
    betweenPages: true,
    samePageWithHash: true,
    samePage: true
  }
}
```

### scrollFriction and scrollAcceleration

The animation behavior of the scroll animation can be adjusted by setting `scrollFriction` and `scrollAcceleration`.

### getAnchorElement

Customize how the scroll target is found on the page. Defaults to standard browser behavior (`#id` first, `a[name]` second).

```javascript
{
  // Use a custom data attribute instead of id
  getAnchorElement: hash => {
    hash = hash.replace('#', '')
    return document.querySelector(`[data-scroll-target="${hash}"]`)
  }
}
```

### Offset

Offset to substract from the final scroll position, to account for fixed headers. Can be either a number or a function that returns the offset.

```javascript
{
  // Number: fixed offset in px
  offset: 30,

  // Function: calculate offset before scrolling
  offset: () => document.querySelector('#header').offsetHeight,

  // The scroll target element is passed into the function
  offset: target => target.offsetHeight * 2,
}
```

### scrollContainers

Customize the selector string used for finding scroll containers other than the `window`. See the
[Scroll Containers](#scroll-containers) section for an explanation of how the plugin deals with
overflowing containers.

```js
{
  // Always restore the scroll position of overflowing tables and sidebars
  scrollContainers: '.overflowing-table, .overflowing-sidebar'
}
```

### shouldResetScrollPosition

Callback function that allows customizing the behavior when a link is clicked. Instead of scrolling
back up on page visits, returning `false` here will instead restore the previous scroll position
recorded for that page. See [Reset vs. restore](#reset-vs-restore) for an explanation and use cases.

```js
{
  // Don't scroll back up for custom back-links, mimicking the browser back button
  shouldResetScrollPosition: (link) => !link.matches('.backlink')
}
```

### Default options

```javascript
new SwupScrollPlugin({
  doScrollingRightAway: false,
  animateScroll: {
    betweenPages: true,
    samePageWithHash: true,
    samePage: true
  },
  scrollFriction: 0.3,
  scrollAcceleration: 0.04,
  getAnchorElement: null,
  offset: 0,
  scrollContainers: `[data-swup-scroll-container]`,
  shouldResetScrollPosition: htmlAnchorElement => true
});
```

## Changes of the swup instance

Scroll Plugin adds the method `scrollTo` to the swup instance, which can be used for custom scrolling.
The method accepts an offset in pixels and a boolean, if the scroll position should be animated:

```js
// will animate the scroll position of the window to 2000px
swup.scrollTo(2000, true);
```

The Plugin also adds two new events `scrollStart` and `scrollDone` to swup, that can be listened to with the `on` method:

```js
swup.on('scrollStart', () => {
  console.log('Swup started scrolling');
});
swup.on('scrollDone', () => {
  console.log('Swup finished scrolling');
});
```
