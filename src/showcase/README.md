# Add Your Site to the Swup Showcase

Have you created a site you want to share with the swup community? Great! Adding it to the Showcase
will highlight your project and encourage others with its design and implementation.

## A Few Guidelines

- **Quality Matters**: We're looking to showcase professional, visually appealing, and accessible websites. Ensure your site meets these criteria before submitting.
- **Give Credit**: Make sure to attribute the agency and/or freelancer who designed and built the site.

## How to Add Your Site

Adding your site to the Swup Showcase is straightforward.

1. **Fork the Docs Repository**:
    - Begin by creating a fork of our [docs repository](https://github.com/swup/docs).
    - This will copy the repository to your account, allowing you to make changes.

2. **Prepare Your Showcase File**:
    - Navigate to the [`showcase/`](https://github.com/swup/docs/tree/main/src/showcase) directory.
    - Make a copy of the [`_showcase.md`](https://github.com/swup/docs/tree/main/src/showcase/_showcase.md) example file.
    - Rename your copy to something descriptive of your site (e.g., `your-site-name.md`).
    - Edit the file to include information about your website, following the template.

3. **Add a Screenshot**:
    - Take a PNG screenshot of your website in a 4:3 landscape ratio of at least 1200px width.
    - Name the screenshot file to match your `.md` file (e.g., `your-site-name.png`).
    - Add this image to the same `showcase/` directory.

4. **Create a Pull Request**:
    - Once you've added the new files, create a pull request against the docs repository.
    - Provide a short description of the addition in the PR and add a link to the site.
    - Submit your PR and wait for a maintainer to review it.

## That's It

We're excited to see your websites and share them with the swup community!
