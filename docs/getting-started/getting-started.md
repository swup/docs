# Getting Started
Looking for **what's new in v2**? Head over [here](https://medium.com/@gmarcuk/introducing-swup-v2-814e40316dee).

New to swup? Little intro: 
 
* It's just ridiculously [easy to use]({{ "/getting-started/example" | relative_url }}), even for beginners.
* Define as many [containers]({{ "/options#containers" | relative_url }}) to replace as you want! You can tell swup to replace even the smallest parts of the page, so you can work with the rest for your animation.
* Use swup [events]({{ "/events" | relative_url }}) to run your JavaScript, trigger analytics, close sidebars or anything you need…
* Forget about timing. swup [detects the end of your animations]({{ "/options#animation-selector" | relative_url }}) and controls the whole lifecycle of transition automatically.
* Don't worry about browser history… swup takes care of it, changes the url when it's needed and preserves browser native behavior on popState events.
* Has some cool additional features for even better experience like [cache]({{ "/options#cache" | relative_url }}), smart [preload]({{ "/plugins/preload-plugin" | relative_url }}) without DDOSing your server, badass smooth "acceleration based" [scroll]({{ "/plugins/scroll-plugin" | relative_url }}) control, helpful [debug plugin]({{ "/plugins/debug-plugin" | relative_url }}), support for [forms]({{ "/plugins/forms-plugin" | relative_url }}) and much more.

In case you like to do your animations in JavaScript, you may want to check out **[js-plugin]({{ "/plugins/js-plugin" | relative_url }})**.

If you're having trouble implementing swup, checkout [Common Issues]({{ "/common-issues" | relative_url }}), [Closed Issues](https://github.com/swup/swup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) or open a [new one](https://github.com/swup/swup/issues/new).
