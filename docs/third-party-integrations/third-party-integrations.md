# 3rd Party Integrations
Some awesome people needed more functionality, so they came up with their own integrations.

Note that these are external projects, and any questions or issues need to be directed to the authors.

If you'd like to list your own project here, just hit me with a link at <a href="mailto:gmarcuk@gmail.com?subject=New swup integration!">gmarcuk@gmail.com</a>.
